Linked Open Data in Life Sciences

The impact of new technologies has meant that the volume of scientific data has experienced a considerable increase in the last decade, generating data that must be managed and integrated so that it is easy for experts to access them. In reality, researchers still face severe logistical and technical challenges in discovering, querying, and integrating heterogeneous data and knowledge from multiple sources

In this work, the current state of Linked Open Data in the life sciences field is analysed, following a systematic methodology, to discover the level of reusability of the public Linked Open Data repositories.
